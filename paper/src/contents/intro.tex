Dating sites. Privacy expectations. Social stigma of online dating. Benign
incentive for breaking: using real identity information to appear more
attractive to the opposite sex. Malicious incentive for breaking: stalking a
non-responsive person.

DateMySchool \cite{dms2014}. Used because it groups by school. Facebook
\cite{fb2014}. Used because everyone is on it.

Main reason for reusing photos: people want to put out their best look on a
dating site, good photos require a lot of effort. It's convenient to grab a
recent good photo. "Good" means it was most likely posted on existing social
networks.
