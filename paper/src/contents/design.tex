Fake accounts at MIT, DMS and FB. Created an artificial person using
average-of-faces face, common names (ref: big bang theory) and a fake birthday.
No unfair advantages, such as using our real social network accounts to extract
more information.

Extracted information using Chrome's remote debugging interface, via a
custom-coded Ruby gem. Crawlers use each site's search functionality, and are
coded as generically as possible. For example, the login code is identical for
DMS and FB.
