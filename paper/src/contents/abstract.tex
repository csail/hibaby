Users of dating websites expect their profiles on these sites to be anonymous.
We conjecture that many users reuse photos from non-anonymous social networks,
such as Facebook, when creating their profiles on dating websites. We exploit
this fact to show a simple method for linking dating profile the profiles.
Specifically, this work introduces a virtually undetectable method for
extracting profile information from social networks and dating websites, and a
deceptively simple method for matching up profile photos, for the purposes of
identifying users on supposedly-anonymous networks.
